# Arduino EMG Prosthetic
# 1. EMG Sensor
  Created a precise EMG sensor from scratch, processing raw EMG signals from electrodes. Filtering was first done to remove excessive noise from the 60Hz range, using a notch and bandpass filter to isolte the usable portion of the signal from 10Hz-150Hz. Following this, active components were used to amplify and shape the signal. This involved using a rectifier and comparator to produce a binary signal that could be fed into the Arduino to trigger an action from the prosthetic.
# 2. Prosthetic
  Prosthetic arm was created using Solidworks 3D models with topology and FEA studies to create a light weight and robust prosthetic.
  A gripper mechanism was also created to house all components, making the prosthetic mobile and a simple plug and play.
